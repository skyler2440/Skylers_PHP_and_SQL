# This will be a collection of things I have done in the past

- SQL Contact form with mail alert. 

    This will lead up to a fully customizable user-interface. 
    From the front to the back end by building a:

- SECURE PHP login system complete with SQL databases

    I will have to redo all of it because most of it has been lost.

    If anyone wants to fork to it and help me out go for it.

# It will be a great oppertunity for those who want to learn PHP and SQL.

- Before I started school the only site's that I knew how to write were in PHP and SQL.

- I would be happy to help anyone wanting to learn.

- DM me if you have any questions

## My first step was to create a 3 part index file with seperate header, footer, and index files.

    - This can later be maipulated by way of Javascript or PHP

# Your first step...

## When you get done all you should have is an HTML contact form

###  Don't Copy/Paste... Write it so you learn it.

    - Figure out how to set up a LAMP/WAMP/MAMP server.

        - Stands for (Insert OS here) Apache Mysql PHP server
    
        Bitnami is the easiest...

    - Create a contact form 

        - Based on the above index.php file create a contact.php file

            - You can build your own stylesheet

            - You do not have to put the href in the header file

            - You do not have to set up the php forms yet but, 
            be sure to give each <input> tag an id attribute of your choosing this will be used later.

            - Be sure to make sure that you call the header and footer

## I will upload one on Monday. If I forget remind me.
